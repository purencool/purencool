# Purencool Drupal 8 

This project allows for a base install using Vagrant Beetbox and an initial install of Drupal 8

All the websites modules can be managed by Composer and Git workflow even on share hosting for small websites.


### Requirements
1. A local installation of Vagrant, Git, and Composer


### Installation

1. Clone master branch of this repo 
2. From the command line navigate cloned repo
3. Make the configure file an executable
4. From the command prompt "bash configure"

This will set up a standard Drupal build with the  
username : admin
password: admin

### Use case
Because the Git repo ignores most of the files in its own directory it allows a team to manage a Drupal website on shared hosting using ssh with the configuration outside the live directory.
