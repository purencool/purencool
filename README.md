# Purencool Drupal 8 initial build

This project allows for a base install using Vagrant Beetbox and an initial install of Drupal 8

All the websites modules can be managed by Composer and Git workflow even on share hosting for small websites.


### Requirements
1. A local installation of Vagrant, Git, and Composer




### Installation

1. Clone master branch of this repo 
2. From the command line navigate cloned repo
3. Make the .install an executable file then bash .install

This will set up a standard Drupal build with the  
username : admin
password: admin

### Use case
Because the Git repo ignores most of the files in its own directory it allows a team to manage a Drupal website on shared hosting using ssh with the configuration outside the live directory.
